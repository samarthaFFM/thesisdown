# doctorRbite

This project was inspired by the [bookdown](http://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) and [thesisdown]() packages.

Currently, the PDF and gitbook versions are fully-functional.  The word and epub versions are developmental, have no templates behind them, and are essentially calls to the appropriate functions in bookdown.

If you are new to working with `bookdown`/`rmarkdown`, please read over the documentation available in the `gitbook` template at https://thesisdown.netlify.com/.  This is also available below at http://ismayc.github.io/thesisdown_book.

The current output for the four versions is here:
- [PDF](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown_book/blob/gh-pages/thesis.pdf) (Generating LaTeX file is available [here](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown_book/blob/gh-pages/thesis.tex) with other files at in the [book directory](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown_book/tree/gh-pages).)
- [Word](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown_book/blob/gh-pages/thesis.docx)
- [ePub](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown_book/blob/gh-pages/thesis.epub)
- [gitbook](http://ismayc.github.io/thesisdown_book)

Under the hood, the a custom LaTeX template is used to ensure that documents conform precisely to the University of Freiburg, faculty f biology submission standards. At the same time, composition and formatting can be done using lightweight [markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) syntax, and **R** code and its output can be seamlessly included using [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

### Using doctorRbite from Vivek's GitHub

Using **doctorRbite** has some prerequisites which are described below. To compile PDF documents using **R**, you are going to need to have LaTeX installed.  It can be downloaded for Windows at <http://http://miktex.org/download> and for Mac at <http://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html>.  Follow the instructions to install the necessary packages after downloading the (somewhat large) installer files.  You may need to install a few extra LaTeX packages on your first attempt to knit as well.

To use **doctorRbite** from RStudio:

1) Install the latest [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
Only the version as of Oct 2017 has a recent enough Pandoc included so you may need to upgrade this
separately or install a newer RStudio.

    ```r
    rmarkdown::pandoc_available("1.2")
    #> [1] TRUE
    ```

2) Install the **bookdown** and **doctorRbite** packages: 

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
devtools::install_github("vivekbhr/doctorRbite")
```

3) Use the **New R Markdown** dialog to select **MPIthesis**:

    Note that this will currently only **Knit** if you name the directory `index` as shown above.

4) After choosing which type of output you'd like in the YAML at the top of index.Rmd, **Knit** the `index.Rmd` file to get the book in PDF or HTML formats.
5) Edit the individual chapter R Markdown files as you wish and then re-run step (4) again.
